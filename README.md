Usage
The notebook is divided into several sections, each covering a specific task. Here's a summary of the tasks covered in the notebook:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The notebook loads two CSV files: Comments.csv and Customers.csv.
Preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and stemming are performed on the comments data.
The preprocessed data is saved to a CSV file (TextDataTokenized1.csv) for further analysis.
Feature Extraction:

Bag-of-Words (Term-Document Matrix) is created using the tokenized and stemmed data.
The Term-Document Matrix is saved to a CSV file (TD_counts-TokenizedStemmed.csv).
TF-IDF matrix is computed from the Term-Document Matrix and saved to a CSV file (TFIDF_counts-TokenizedStemmed.csv).
Data Integration:

The TF-IDF matrix is merged with the customer information data.
One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features.
The combined data is saved to a CSV file (Combined2-Cust+TFIDF+SelectedFeatures.csv).
Feature Selection:

Feature selection techniques such as Fisher score and random forest classifier are used to select the top features.
The selected features are saved to a CSV file (TFIDF_counts-Selected Features.csv).
Classification:

Random Forest Classifier is trained and tested using the selected features.
Accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report are generated.
Summary
The text analytics notebook demonstrates the process of preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification tasks using text data. By following the provided steps, you can replicate the analysis and apply it to your own text datasets.

Please note that this is a summary of the notebook's content, and it is recommended to refer to the notebook itself for detailed code explanations and additional information.
